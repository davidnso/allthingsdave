      Hi, Iâ€™m David. Nice to meet you.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since the age of 5 I've been captivated by art and design. In the last 4
      Years software development has become one of my passions. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and
      perpetually working on improving my chops one design and one app at a time.
